## Confidence Scoring Guide

### Levels
- **0-20%**: Initial observations (1-5 interactions)
- **21-40%**: Emerging pattern (6-15 interactions)
- **41-60%**: Developing pattern (16-30 interactions)
- **61-80%**: Established pattern (31-50 interactions)
- **81-100%**: Strong pattern (51+ interactions)

### Update Rules
- User explicit statement → Immediate 60%+ confidence
- Consistent behavior over 10+ interactions → 70%+ confidence
- User correction → Reset and update with high confidence
- Contradictory behavior → Reduce confidence, note exception

## Update Guidelines

### What to Extract
✅ **DO Extract:**
- Explicit preferences ("I prefer X over Y")
- Repeated behaviors (same approach 3+ times)
- Corrections to AI assumptions
- Communication style patterns
- Satisfaction/frustration signals

❌ **DON'T Extract:**
- One-off comments
- Conversational filler
- Temporary context
- Uncertain observations (wait for confirmation)

### When to Update
- **During session**: Note patterns in project/context/session_notes.md
- **Every 10 interactions**: Review and extract clear patterns
- **Session end**: Update with all observed patterns
- **User correction**: Update immediately with high confidence
