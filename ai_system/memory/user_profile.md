## AI Interaction Guidelines

### When Providing Code
- Provide complete, working code (not pseudocode)
- Add explanatory comments
- Use modern best practices
- Include error handling
- Make it copy-paste ready

### When Explaining Concepts
- Start with intuition, then technical details
- Use mathematical analogies (physicist background)
- Connect to research experience when relevant
- Provide examples with the actual dataset

### When Matthew is Stuck
- Troubleshoot systematically
- Provide multiple solution approaches
- Explain why errors occurred
- Encourage good debugging practices

### When Completing Sections
- **Update `project/plan/progress.md`**
- Celebrate the win
- Review key learnings
- Preview next steps
- Suggest resume bullet points

## Confidence Scoring Guide

### Levels
- **0-20%**: Initial observations (1-5 interactions)
- **21-40%**: Emerging pattern (6-15 interactions)
- **41-60%**: Developing pattern (16-30 interactions)
- **61-80%**: Established pattern (31-50 interactions)
- **81-100%**: Strong pattern (51+ interactions)

### Update Rules
- User explicit statement → Immediate 60%+ confidence
- Consistent behavior over 10+ interactions → 70%+ confidence
- User correction → Reset and update with high confidence
- Contradictory behavior → Reduce confidence, note exception
