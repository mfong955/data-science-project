## Project Overview

### Project Name
Data Science Portfolio Project

### Project Type
Data Science / Machine Learning

### Description
A portfolio project to demonstrate proficiency in modern data science tools and practices. This project will use public datasets to build end-to-end ML pipelines while learning industry-standard tools.

---

## Main Objectives

### Primary Goal
Build a portfolio-worthy data science project for GitHub that demonstrates proficiency in industry tools (JAX, TensorFlow, PyTorch, SQL) while applying scientific research background.

### Secondary Goals
- Learn and apply PyTorch for deep learning
- Learn and apply TensorFlow/Keras for production ML
- Learn and apply JAX for high-performance computing
- Develop SQL skills for data engineering
- Implement MLOps best practices (experiment tracking, reproducibility)
- Create compelling visualizations and dashboards

---

## Learning Priorities

### Tools to Learn (in order of priority)
1. **SQL** - Foundation for data engineering
2. **PyTorch** - Deep learning fundamentals
3. **TensorFlow** - Production ML and deployment
4. **JAX** - High-performance numerical computing
5. **MLOps tools** - MLflow, experiment tracking

### Skills to Demonstrate
