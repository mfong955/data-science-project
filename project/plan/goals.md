## Project Overview

### Project Name
E-Commerce Purchase Prediction & Customer Journey Optimization

### Project Type
Data Science / Machine Learning / Product Analytics

### Description
A comprehensive data science portfolio project analyzing consumer behavior patterns, building predictive models, and generating actionable business insights. This project demonstrates product analytics, statistical modeling, A/B testing, and business insight generation skills targeting the OpenAI Product Data Scientist role.

### Dataset
AI-Driven Consumer Behavior Dataset (Kaggle, 2025)
- Source: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ziya07/ai-driven-consumer-behavior-dataset
- Size: ~10,000+ customer sessions
- Features: Purchase decisions, clickstream behavior, reviews, demographics

## Main Objectives

### Primary Goal
Build a portfolio-worthy data science project for GitHub that demonstrates proficiency in product analytics, statistical rigor, and modern data science tools while targeting the OpenAI Product Data Scientist role.

### Secondary Goals
- Define and track key product metrics (conversion rate, AOV, cart abandonment)
- Perform customer segmentation using K-means clustering
- Build predictive models for purchase conversion (target: >0.80 AUC)
- Design and analyze A/B tests with statistical rigor
- Generate data-driven business recommendations with quantified impact
- Develop SQL proficiency through practical queries
- Create compelling visualizations and dashboards
