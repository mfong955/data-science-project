## Decision Log

### 2024-12-02 - Project Structure Decision
**Type**: Setup
**Decision**: Use data science project template with specialized AI personas
**Reasoning**: User wants to learn industry tools (JAX, TensorFlow, PyTorch, SQL) and build portfolio projects. Personas provide focused expertise for different aspects of data science work.
**Impact**: Enables multi-agent workflow where AI assumes appropriate expert role based on task
**Status**: Completed

### 2024-12-02 - Persona System Design
**Type**: Architecture
**Decision**: Created 8 specialized personas for data science workflow
**Reasoning**: Different aspects of data science (data engineering, ML frameworks, MLOps, visualization) require different expertise. Personas allow focused, expert-level guidance.
**Impact**: AI can provide specialized help by assuming appropriate persona
**Status**: Completed

### 2024-12-02 - Learning Priority Order
**Type**: Direction
**Decision**: Prioritize SQL → PyTorch → TensorFlow → JAX → MLOps
**Reasoning**: SQL is foundational for data engineering. PyTorch for deep learning fundamentals. TensorFlow for production. JAX for advanced performance. MLOps ties it together.
**Impact**: Guides project development and learning sequence
**Status**: In Progress

## Session Summaries

### 2024-12-02 - Session 1
**Focus**: Project infrastructure setup
**Accomplishments**:
- Created AI personas file with 8 specialized roles
- Set up data science folder structure (data, notebooks, src, models, experiments, etc.)
- Updated main README with persona references and learning guidance
- Configured user profile with background (scientific research, statistical modeling)
- Updated goals with learning priorities
- Created .gitignore for data science projects

**Decisions Made**:
- Use persona system for multi-agent workflow
- Follow standard data science project structure
- Prioritize working code over placeholders

**Next Steps**:
- Select public dataset for portfolio project
- Define specific project scope
